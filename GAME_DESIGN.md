# Infestium: Infestation Protocol - Game Design Document

## 1. Game Overview
**Title:** Infestium: Infestation Protocol
**Genre:** Strategic Infestation Simulation / Global Strategy
**Core Concept:** Players take control of a burgeoning biological infestation network, strategically spreading influence across a global map. The goal is to evolve, expand, and dominate the world through various means—from covert infiltration to overwhelming force.

## 2. Core Gameplay Loop
The game revolves around three primary pillars:
1.  **Expand:** Spread infestation to new territories and regions using tactical placement and growth mechanics.
2.  **Evolve:** Gather resources (DNA, Biomass) to upgrade agents, unlocking new abilities and specializations.
3.  **Dominate:** Overcome human resistance (military, medical, political) and manage global events to achieve victory.

## 3. World & Strategy
### Global Map
-   **Interactive World:** A detailed global map serves as the main strategic interface.
-   **Territories:** The world is divided into distinct regions and territories. Each territory has specific attributes (population, defense, scientific capability).
-   **Dynamic Simulation:** Territories simulate real-time population dynamics, including growth, decline, and recovery from infestation.

### Resource Management
Players must manage key resources to fuel their expansion:
-   **Biomass:** Gained from consuming biological matter; used for physical growth and agent creation.
-   **Energy:** Metabolic energy required for sustaining the network and powering active abilities.
-   **Genetic Material (DNA):** Harvested from successful infections; used for evolution and research.

### Strategic Planning
-   **Long-term Strategy:** Success requires balancing rapid expansion with sustainability and stealth.
-   **Time Management:** Campaigns may span generations, requiring adaptation to shifting global eras and technological advancements.

## 4. Agents & Evolution
### Agent Classes
Players can develop specialized agents to suit different playstyles:
-   **Infiltration Agents:** Stealthy units designed to penetrate high-security areas without detection.
-   **Combat Agents:** Aggressive strains built to overwhelm military defenses and hold territory.
-   **Research Agents:** Specialized in analyzing threats and generating genetic points faster.
-   **Hive Mind:** Central nodes that coordinate other agents and provide global bonuses.

### Evolution Tree
A complex skill tree allows for deep customization:
-   **Genetic Engineering:** A visual interface for modifying agent DNA. Balance risk/reward to create stable or volatile strains.
-   **Adaptation:** Evolve traits to survive in specific environments (e.g., Cold Resistance, Urban Camouflage).
-   **Symbiosis:** Develop abilities to coexist with hosts for mutual benefit, increasing stealth and longevity.
-   **Technological Integration:** Later stages may allow bio-mechanical hybrids that co-opt human technology.

## 5. Dynamic Systems & Opposition
### Humanity's Response
The world does not stand still. Humanity will react to the threat:
-   **Government Response:** Nations will deploy military forces, enforce quarantines, and close borders.
-   **Scientific Research:** Human scientists will work to develop cures, detection methods, and countermeasures.
-   **Political & Media:**
    -   **Information Warfare:** Control public perception. Use misinformation to delay panic or create chaos.
    -   **Diplomacy:** Nations may form alliances against the threat or squabble amongst themselves, creating openings.

### Global Events
-   **Geopolitical Events:** Wars, treaties, and economic shifts can alter the strategic landscape.
-   **Crises:** Natural disasters or man-made accidents can provide cover for expansion or threaten established hives.
-   **Economic Impact:** Infestation can cause market crashes and supply chain disruptions, affecting both human resilience and available resources.

## 6. Victory Conditions
Players can win through multiple distinct paths:
-   **Conquest:** Total domination of the globe through military force and overwhelming infection rates.
-   **Assimilation:** Integrating the infestation into the human population so deeply that separation is impossible.
-   **Symbiosis:** Establishing a mutually beneficial relationship where humanity accepts the infestation.
-   **Transcendence:** Evolving the infestation into a higher form of life, perhaps leaving the planet or fundamentally changing reality.

## 7. Future Concepts
-   **Multi-generational Campaigns:** Managing a lineage of infestations over centuries.
-   **Ethical Dilemmas:** Systems that explore the morality of survival and evolution from the perspective of the "Other."
-   **Procedural Ecology:** Complex food webs where the infestation becomes a new apex predator or a foundational part of the ecosystem.
